A few words about me: I am a 2nd year graduate student in Industrial Engineering at **North Carolina State University**. My research interests lie in Data Sciecne, Programming, Automation and Statistics. Out of academia, I generally like to:
  * Explore new places
  * Take a hike, mostly at
      + Mountains
      + Canyons
  * Play Music
  * Watch Formula 1
