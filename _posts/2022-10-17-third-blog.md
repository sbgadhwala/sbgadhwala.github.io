# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

As a data scientist, one of the very first tasks when given a data is to understand the data. A lot of tools provide the ability to perform data analysis, R, Python, SAS to nanme some. An inital go-through to understand the dimensionality and all the various variables is the first step towards Exploratory Data Analysis. However, EDA is a lot more than that. Being a data scientist, you whould have an indepth idea about the field you're working in, and hence a end target or aim for why the analysis has to be conducted should be clear. One can reach out to higher managers to set the goals ans expectations out of the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis can be done on from a single variable in the data set to the whole data itself. Based on the type of variables we are dealing with, we can proceed accordingly. The most common starting point is the summary of the data, which provides us some general statistics like miminum value, maximum value, mean, etc about numeric data in the data set. Moving onto the next step, one of the important analysis would be to count the number of missing variables, and of possible fill them with either mean or median of the data, depending on distribution.

## Understanding the data

Understanding the type of each variable is impoartant, whether to classify the variable as continous/discrete/categorical/binary etc, becomes critical when performign EDA. The next process to undertand more about the data, is to just plot it. A simple scatter plot made for any varibale is enough to convey any patterns that the variable is exhibiting. Similar scatter plots can be laid out for all variables. This would help in understanding any seasonalities trend in the dta which is quite useful when performing time series analysis and its prediction.

The catergorical variables are also of a huge help when it comes to plotting the difference between each variable with respect to the categorical variable(s).
