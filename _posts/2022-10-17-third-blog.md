# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

As a data scientist, one of the very first tasks when given a data is to understand the data. An inital go-through to understand the dimensionality and all the various variables is the first step towards Exploratory Data Analysis. However, EDA is a lot more than that. Being a data scientist, you whould have an indepth idea about the field you're working in, and hence a end target or aim for why the analysis has to be conducted should be clear. One can reach out to higher managers to set the goals ans expectations out of the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis can be done from a single variable in the data set to the whole data itself. Based on the type of variables we are dealing with, we can proceed accordingly. The most common starting point is the summary of the data, which provides us some general statistics like miminum value, maximum value, mean, etc about numeric data in the data set.
