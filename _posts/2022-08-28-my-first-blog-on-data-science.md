## The Hybrid Theory of Data Scienst

In this blog, I would like to highlight a few aspects and differences about what data scientists work on with respect to their close neighbors, statisticians, that share more or less simialar technicalities.

## Who are Data Scientists?

Someone gave a very subtle definition of a data scientist, and it could not have been said any better:
*"A data scientist is someone who is better at programming than any statistitican, and is better at statistics than any programmer."*

Being a data scientist means you would have to have knowledge of both statistics, and computer science. You would not only have to know how to extract useful data from a huge data set, but also have to tell a story using that data such that it turns into a useful chunk of information that can be used either in business purposes, or just in general to improve the efficiency of operations. 
A hidden third requirement to be a data scientist is to have a in-depth knowledge on the field that they are workign on, be it a particularly biche industry, or a generalized horizontal business model. Without the third factor, the first two becomes obsolete. To be a excellent data scientist, the three factors have to work in a closed coalition.

But enough about the requirements, what do data scientists actually do? 
A data sceintist is able to read huge amount of data efficiently, scapre it, mine it, transform it when needed, and most importantly extract the useful information that lies in it (sometimes it is done using just simple visualization techniques, or sometimes it is done by rigorous programming to extract hidden information from layers and layers of data). A data scientist is someone who has a solid foundation of statistics, knwos the principles and undertsands how to interprete the results from various statistical models. Advancing from that setp, a data scientist is also able to develop machine learning algorithms to find and extract a pattern of target to predict future of the partucaular niche operation more accurately, and can drive business decisions accordingly.

To summarize in brief, a data sceintist has knowledge of (atleat) a dominating programming lanhuage (Python, R, SAS, etc), a strong foundation of statistics (model buidling, regressions, etc), and can build machine learning models using big-data algorithms (which includes data mining and may inclulde data transofrmation).
