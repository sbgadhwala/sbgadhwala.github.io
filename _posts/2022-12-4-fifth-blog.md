# Data Science Takeaways

## What I would be doing differently:

Data science is a huge field and, with the help of ST558: Data Science for Statisticians course offered by the math department at North Carolina State University, I learned a lot about about different prospects of it. After going through coursework throughout the semester, I am confident to say that from now on all of my visualizations will be done on R language since it offers a broad range of plots, methods of visualizations, and then some. The ease of plots and representations surpasses any other languages, and during the course, I got to know about a lot of them. 

With the help of packages such as tidyverse, I also am confident that querying through the data, manupulating it, will all be done on R language, and, to build quick machine learning models and to see model's predictions, I would be using caret package to do so, rather than doing it so on any other language.

Another point I would like to note out is the leaflet package, even though we did not have any detailed conversations about it in the class, I used it extensively for two of my other courses that required geo-spatial analysis, and I am a big fan of that, hence leaflet package is something I will keep handy to do any geo-spatial analysis.  


## Future Career  

I am looking for a career in data science field itself. With my previous proferssional work experience, and with the summer internship's project, I know a lot of applications of Operations Research and Data Science, and I would like to apply my knowledge in the same area. Specifically, I am looking for a career in geospatial analysis, like weather science, or environmental science, or something like what I did in my [2nd project](https://sbgadhwala.github.io/ST558_Project2/).
